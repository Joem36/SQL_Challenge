# SQL-employees 


I first designed tables to organize the data from the CSV files, ensuring a structured layout for efficient storage and retrieval (data modeling). The main objective here was to create a database schema that accurately represents the data from the CSV files.

Next, I imported the CSV files into a SQL database, transforming raw data into a structured format ready for analysis (data engineering). The primary goal was to prepare the data for analysis by loading it into a relational database management system (RDBMS) where it could be queried effectively.

With the data organized and stored, I then delved into querying the database to answer various questions about the employees, departments, and their relationships (data analysis). The main objective here was to extract insights from the data to understand employee details, department management, and other relevant information, facilitating informed decision-making and deeper understanding of the dataset. Each SQL query provided valuable insights aligned with this objective.
